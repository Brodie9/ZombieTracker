# ZombieTracker
Interface design term project, March 2011

A collaboration between Brodie Roberts, Jason Cummer, and Robert Prior 
for class SEng 310 at the University of Victoria.

Run as:   java ZombieTracker


This semi-functional user interface mockup is the result of a term project 
in a Human Computer Interaction class.

Our team started with the idea of an app that would help you survive in a zombie apocalypse.
We began by listing all of the functionality we wanted it to have, and organizing those functions into logical groups.
We wrote three character personas, and gave each an accompanying situation and set of tasks. We used these to motivate more functionality ideas.
We conducted user interviews to find out what other people would want our app to be able to do. The best of these suggestions were incorporated into the design.
With all of the functionality picked, we grouped functions into pages and into a general layout.
We hand-drew all of the pages and views of the app on template images of an iPhone screen, and detailed which buttons would link between views.
We ran all of our drawings through a useability analysis, and tweaked as needed.
We programmed a mockup of this interface in Java, only implementing the buttons and views required to complete the three sets of tasks outlined with our characters.
We conducted a second set of user interviews, getting each person to use our app to follow along with a test script. We observed what they had trouble with and recorded their reactions. We used these responses to improve the difficult parts of our design.
Our finished mockup was sent to three other students in our class to conduct a useability analysis on. We got this feedback and used it to make a few final adjustments.
We presented our finished mockup to the class and submitted a paper fully detailing the design process.


Feel free to run this mockup and explore what it can do. Keep in mind that some of the buttons do nothing.
